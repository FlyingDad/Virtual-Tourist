## Notice
The current version is working with Xcode Version 8.

## Description
The Virtual Tourist app downloads and stores images from Flickr. 
The app allows users to drop pins on a map, as if they were stops on a tour. 
Users will then be able to download pictures for the location and persist both the pictures, and the association of the pictures with the pin.

## Why this project?
The project requires to persist a complex model using Core Data, and plist persistence of an array of dictionaries - core skills required of any iOS Developer.

## What I learned?
* How to use NSURLSessions to interact with a public restful API.
* How to create a user interface that intuitively communicates network activity and download progress.
* How to use Core Data for local persistence of an data.

## Why is this project meaningful to my career?
The project will gave me practice with powerful mechanisms for persisting data locally on a device. Storing media and retrieving it later is an essential skill for any iOS developer.
